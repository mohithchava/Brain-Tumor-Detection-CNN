# Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN
Detecting Brain Tumor from MRI using CNN
•	Devised an Image Classification ML model to detect if a given Brain MRI scan has a tumor to reduce the tumor detection time
•	Designed CNN Architecture with Keras and Tensor Flow packages
•	Developed neural network with best-tried layers to achieve 96.22% accuracy
